# About
This is a web based tool, to automatically parse and process results of [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com/) tournaments, usually called Scrims. This tool was written by me (Trikami) ([Twitter](https://x.com/TrikamiJolteon), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/trikamijolteon)) wanting to do more Scrims in SAR, but I was too lazy to punch these numbers into Excel by hand every time.
